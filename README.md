# Synthetic Wave Videos

This project contains MATLAB scripts to create synthetic videos with a gird of rotating dots to simulating wave patterns. These synthetic videos with known wave patterns can later be used to verify the effectiveness of DDM Analysis in recovering wave information from raw videos.

## Files

1. **`make_circle_videos.mlx`**: Directly visualizes dots on a frame using MATLAB's native plotting and then synthesizes these into a video.
2. **`make_circle_videos_pixel.mlx`**: Computes pixels on a frame based on dot locations and then synthesizes the frames into a video.
3. **`make_colored_circle_videos_pixel.mlx`**: Similar to the previous script but colors the dots based on their phase.


## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.
3. Choose and open the desired `.mlx` file.
4. Adjust any parameters or settings if necessary within the script.
5. Execute the script to generate the video.
